<p>This week the price of Bitcoin has surpassed 23k, reaching a new all-time high. This surge is very reminiscent of 2017 year-end which brought a new wave of amateur investors, including myself, into the cryptocurrency space. To preface, I have no fiscal credentials of any sort and therefore none of this discussion should be taken as financial advice. This is mostly intended as a reflection of my personal cryptocurrency investing over the last 3 years and some recommendations if you are legitimately interested in the cryptocurrency market. I do not have a lot of money, so my investments are from the perspective of a hobbyist in the technology, finance, and trading space with a preference for simple living and financial independence.</p>

<h2>Should You Invest?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The answer, as always, is that it depends. First off, if you are reading this post, you are most likely privileged enough to even consider the viability of cryptocurrency as a legitimate investment. For most Americans, the best (albeit amateur) financial advice I can relay is to max out your 401k matching or invest in sustainable mutual funds. These are your safest options. If you do not already have such a portfolio, then cryptocurrency is not a sound investment. While I believe the long-term returns will be generous, the short-term volatility is extreme. Do not invest money you need.</p>

<h2>My Experience</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After an initial impulsive investment in which I bought ETH and LTC at their all-time highs (FOMO), I have been dollar cost averaging very small amounts of money into cryptocurrency since winter 2017. When I invest this money, in the short term I consider it an expense with no return. My methodology thus far has been as follows: skip Chipotle, buy XLM.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>XLM, or Lumens, run on the Stellar network which provide the opportunity for low-cost international money transfers between people, even those who have no access to traditional banks (<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/earn/stellar">https://www.coinbase.com/earn/stellar</a>). There are many new cryptocurrencies which pose the ability to revolutionize the banking industry. Stellar seems to have good intentions, and therefore I feel it to be a worthwhile investment, irrespective of potential future returns.</p>

<h2>Minimalism</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately, minimalism (and stoicism, asceticism, intermittent fasting) has become somewhat bastardized by today’s content creators (like me, right now) and advertisers. However, I use the phrase because I am supportive of a certain level of anti-consumption / anti-excess. I think cryptocurrencies are one technology in which we can invest with the ultimate goal of supporting technologies with altruistic goals in lieu of buying more things and more stuff.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Without diverging into a completely tangential lecture, if you truly have expendable income, first consider some sort of charitable donation or investment in something sustainable or humanitarian. As mentioned, Bitcoin or altcoin investing should only be considered if you truly have some expendable income. My ultimate point is that I think minimalism and minimalist-minded investing can redirect some of our time and energy away from things and into sustainable infrastructure for the betterment of society. &nbsp;</p>
